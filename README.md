# Dracula DAO DREP

## Objectives
We believe in taking an ultra long-term approach to important decisions. We will not vote for what we believe are short sighted decisions and will generally not support proposals for treasury funds being used for venture capital or short-term marketing efforts, unless there is a compelling benefit to the ecosystem and there is low risk. Burning ADA tokens is a non-starter.

## Qualifications
General experience in crypto since 2012 and specifically Cardano since 2018. Experience working with Bitcoin, Ethereum, most of the EVM L2's, Near, Solana and of course Cardano.
