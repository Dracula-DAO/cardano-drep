# Treasury Budgeting for Decentralized Projects using an Agile Development Approach

April 24, 2025

## Problem

The current Cardano budget approval system is chaotic and puts a lot of extra work on DREPs to evaluate, vett and prioritize features and budgets. As the proposals come in, each budget has been created with its own criteria, standarda, and funding status which creates the following problems:

* The budget Net Change Limit (the maximum amount in ADA to spend in the budget year) is unrelated to the sum of proposal requests.  Currently the requests outspend the NCL and there is no well-defined mechanism to reconcile this.
* There is no uniform standard for proposals. Some proposals may need incremental funding, some want their entire budget funded and there is a non-zero probability that at least some of the proposals will not deliver a successful outcome.
* DREPs must vote on each proposal independently, yes or no, after spending time evaluating each one on various critera (ability to deliver, is budget in-line with value and project complexity, reputation, etc).  There are currently almost two hundred proposals.

This process makes little sense from a software development standpoint. For marketing and other budget categories it may be more appropriate, but this blog post is focused on software development and features.

## Proposal

This proposal is for a decentralized development process following roughly an Agile workflow, adapted for use within the scope of decentralized Cardano governance. It focuses on on-chain decision making for high-level features and budgets, but uses iterative funding based on results using off-chain workflows.

The Agile approach to software development is a well accepted team methodology that is iterative, based on one or two week sprints.  Each sprint contains stories (self contained feature-based development units, each of which are expected to be able to be completed within a single sprint).  These stories are agreed upon through negotiation between the Agile roles of Scrum Master and Product Owner.

For detailed information on the Agile approach see the [Agile Alliance](https://www.agilealliance.org/) website, or some of the other many excellent sites available online.

This proposal attempts to adapt the various Agile roles to a decentralized environment, and changes the current budget proposal process (based on high-level features + budget voting units) into feature-only requests that are not directly attached to any specific budget or funding. By iterating on short 2-week stories and having teams bid on work we can make work easier for DREPs and simultaneously introduce competition into the development process to achieve better, more consistent results for the Cardano community.

### Step 1 - (on-chain) Feature Requests and Budget Determination

This step requires DREPs to prioritize high-level feature EPICs (i.e. Ouroborus Leios, Midgard) that are not attached to any specific budget numbers, just a description of the deliverable from a high-level user perspective. Feature requests are basically the current budget proposal outlines, with no funding amount attached to the proposal and without a focus on process, just a high level feature description. They are the rough equivalent of Agile "epics" that will (usually) require multiple sprints to complete.  DREPs should be able to prioritize and vote on features without being concerned about budget amounts or a team's ability to deliver.

As a separate workflow, DREPs approve budget spending but at a high level based on categories, i.e. Software Development budget, Marketing budget, etc. This step can also include the DREPs determining a Net Change Limit similar to how it's done now.

By separating features from budgets, the work will become much easier for DREPs and pushes decisions on funding and process to off-chain workflows focused on 2-week Agile sprints.

### Step 2 - (off-chain) Product Owner and Scrum Master nomination

Each feature request that is prioritized and approved by a majority of DREPs will become an active epic for this year's budget.  Each feature needs to have a Product Owner and a Scrum Master.  The Product Owner and Scrum Master must have a working relationship as they will together be determining stories in the backlog for each epic.

Voting for these roles could be an off-chain process, similar to how the current steering committee voting works at Intersect. For now let's assume these roles have been chosen by some means, either DREPs or delegated to steering committees.

### Step 3 - (off-chain) Story Selection and Team Bidding

This step is where this proposal deviates somewhat from the standard Agile approach. For each 2-week sprint, the Product Owner and Scrum Master will select stories that they believe can be completed over the upcoming sprint. The Product Owner selects stories from the backlog based on feature priority and the Scrum Master filters those based on complexity and team bidding.

In this stage, any team is free to bid on the upcoming sprint's work. Teams submit bids to the Scrum Master: estimated complexity in a standard (1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 13) rating. The Scrum Master selects the team with the best fit based on lowest bid and team fit for the story.

This introduces a competitive element to the implmentation process and should contribute to keeping costs low while choosing teams that are a best fit for the specific work in the current sprint.

### Step 4 - (on-chain) Sprint commitment, work and funding

Once teams are matched to stories by the Scrum Master role, the sprint is funded based on complexity and budgets. Greater complexity stories get more budget than lower complexity ones. This funding is committed to in a smart contract that either pays out to the team at the end of the sprint (if both the Product Owner and Scrum Master sign off on the work), or the funding is retured to the budget for the next sprint in the case a story is not completed by the end of the sprint.

### Repeat - go to Step 3

Sprints are repeated, as necessary until the feature (epic) is complete.

## Advantages

We believe this type of process has the following advantages:

* Feature determination and prioritization is separated from budgeting (less work for DREPs).
* Competition between teams is introduced into the software development process.
* The software development process and status is transparent and visible to the entire decentralized community through the entire development lifecycle.
* Budget spending is directly related to the successful completion of incremental work units by the best team for the specific story.
