We believe Leios, Hydra, Midgard and developer tools / experience are items that definitely belong on the near-term roadmap.\n\nThe roadmap as a whole is hard to distill down into a simple Yes / No vote, especially without any budgets and timelines.  However, since this is simply a non-binding info action we are choosing to vote \"Yes\" to indicate to the governance community our general support of the roadmap as presented."
