Tempo is a good tool and needs UI work, however, the ask amount is overpriced for a 6 month operating budget. We 
run 6 relay nodes, preview and preprod testnet nodes plus a midnight node for less than 5% of that. We also 
believe development should be incentivized through the treasury, not have the entire budget come from the 
treasury.
